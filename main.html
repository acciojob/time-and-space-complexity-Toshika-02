	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, typically expressed as a function of the input size.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires. It is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.</p>
